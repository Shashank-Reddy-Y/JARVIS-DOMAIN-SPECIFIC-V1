By combining the foundational overview from **Wikipedia** with five recent arXiv surveys and studies, we can see how AI is being integrated into clinical workflows, the new technological paradigms emerging, the security and privacy challenges that accompany it, and the future directions that researchers are pursuing.  \nBelow is a detailed, structured synthesis that draws exclusively on the provided context, respects the required citation format, and expands each section with bullet\u2011point explanations, comparisons, and a discussion of current state, challenges, and future outlook.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Concepts and High\u2011Level Overview\n\n### Wikipedia Summary (2023)\n\n> *Artificial intelligence in healthcare is the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and understand complex medical and healthcare data. In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.*  \n> Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare)\n\nThis concise definition frames AI in healthcare as a data\u2011driven, analytical technology that can:\n\n- **Detect patterns** invisible to human clinicians.\n- **Accelerate decision\u2011making** (e.g., real\u2011time imaging analysis).\n- **Improve outcomes** through more precise diagnostics and personalized treatment plans.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Machine Learning Applications in Healthcare (MRA)\n\n**Paper:** *Machine Learning Applications In Healthcare: The State Of Knowledge and Future Directions*  \nAuthors: Mrinmoy Roy, Sarwar J. Minar, Porarthi Dhar, A T M Omor Faruq  \nPublished: 2023\u201107\u201126 (ArXiv ID: 2307.14067)\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Detection of hidden patterns**: ML\u2019s fast processing power allows it to uncover subtle medical signals that may be missed by traditional statistical methods.  \n- **Indispensability**: As the summary states, ML has become indispensable to the modern healthcare system.  \n- **Future directions**: Though the summary is truncated, the paper\u2019s title suggests a comprehensive review of current knowledge and a roadmap for future research.\n\n### Comparative Insights\n\n| Feature | MRA (Roy et\u202fal.) | IoT\u2011Personalized Services | Zero\u2011Trust ML Architecture | Federated Learning |\n|---------|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Primary focus** | ML techniques & applications | Integration of IoT devices for personalized care | Cybersecurity for ML in IoT | Privacy\u2011preserving distributed ML |\n| **Data source** | Centralized clinical datasets | Wearable & remote monitoring devices | Edge devices + cloud | Edge devices + central aggregator |\n| **Key advantage** | Rapid pattern detection | Real\u2011time patient monitoring | Robust security & trust | Data privacy + model improvement |\n| **Typical use\u2011case** | Diagnostic imaging, predictive analytics | Chronic disease monitoring | Secure model deployment | Multi\u2011institutional collaboration |\n\n---\n\n## 3.
