Overview & Current State\n\nBlockchain technology has evolved from a niche component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to a foundational layer that underpins a wide array of industries. At its core, a blockchain is a tamper\u2011resistant ledger that records transactions in a series of cryptographically linked blocks. The decentralized nature of most blockchains eliminates the need for a central authority, providing transparency, immutability, and security.\n\n### 1.1 Technological Landscape (2024)\n\n- **Layer\u20111 Blockchains** such as Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the most widely recognized public chains, offering robust security and large developer communities.  \n- **Layer\u20112 Solutions** (state channels, roll\u2011ups, sidechains) have gained traction by off\u2011loading compute or data from the base layer to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs.  \n- **Private/Consortium Chains**: Organizations in finance, supply chain, and healthcare deploy permissioned blockchains to meet regulatory or privacy requirements.  \n- **Interoperability Protocols**: Projects like Polkadot, Cosmos, and the Inter\u2011Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol aim to connect disparate chains, enabling cross\u2011chain asset transfer and data sharing.  \n\n### 1.2 Current Use Cases\n\n| Industry | Typical Application | Example |\n|----------|---------------------|---------|\n| Finance | Decentralized finance (DeFi), cross\u2011border payments, digital identity | **General**: Peer\u2011to\u2011peer lending, liquidity pools, stablecoins |\n| Supply chain | Provenance tracking, audit trails | **General**: Tracking raw materials from source to consumer |\n| Healthcare | Secure patient data exchange, provenance of medical devices | **General**: Electronic health record (EHR) sharing, drug traceability |\n| Governance | Transparent voting systems, public record keeping | **General**: Municipal voting, land registry |\n| Intellectual property | Timestamping and proof of ownership for creative works | **General**: Digital art, patents |\n\n> **Additional context needed**: Precise statistics on market penetration, growth rates, or concrete company case studies would require up\u2011to\u2011date, domain\u2011specific sources that are not present in the current context.\n\n---\n\n## 2.
