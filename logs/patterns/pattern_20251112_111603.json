We will also fetch the latest news articles to understand the current trends and developments in the field. After summarizing the academic papers and news articles, we will create a visual report to present the data effectively. Finally, we will use the QA engine to synthesize the information into a detailed answer, ensuring that the response is comprehensive and up-to-date.",
