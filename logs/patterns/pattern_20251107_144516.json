    "reasoning": "To provide a comprehensive overview of recent AI advances in climate science, we will first gather academic summaries via arxiv_summarizer and recent news via news_fetcher. Then we will generate visual representations of key breakthroughs using data_plotter. The qa_engine will synthesize all gathered information into a cohesive narrative, and finally document_writer will compile the text and visuals into a polished PDF report.",
