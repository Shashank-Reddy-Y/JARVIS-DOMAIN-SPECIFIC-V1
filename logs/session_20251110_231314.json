The main focus is on the reasoning behind the decisions or predictions made by the AI algorithms, to make them more understandable and transparent. This addresses users' requirement to assess safety and scrutinize the automated decision making in applications. XAI counters the \"black box\" tendency of machine learning, where even the AI's designers cannot explain why it arrived at a specific decision.\n\n**Source:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence)",
