Introduction  \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the landscape of modern medicine. According to the Wikipedia entry on *Artificial intelligence in healthcare* (source: Wikipedia), AI in this domain \u201cis the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and understand complex medical and healthcare data. In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.\u201d  \n\nThe five arXiv papers summarized below build on this foundational definition by exploring concrete implementations, emerging paradigms, and the attendant risks that accompany the diffusion of AI throughout clinical and operational workflows. By weaving together these perspectives, we derive a nuanced picture of the current state, challenges, and future trajectories of AI\u2011driven healthcare.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. AI in Healthcare \u2013 Scope and Core Capabilities  \n\n| Domain | Typical AI Tasks | Key Advantages |\n|--------|------------------|----------------|\n| **Diagnosis** | Image segmentation, pattern recognition in imaging, signal analysis in ECG/EKG | Faster, more accurate detection of subtle pathologies |\n| **Treatment Planning** | Treatment recommendation engines, optimization of drug dosing | Personalizes therapy, reduces trial\u2011and\u2011error |\n| **Prevention & Screening** | Risk stratification, predictive modeling of disease onset | Enables earlier intervention, lowers healthcare costs |\n| **Operational Efficiency** | Workflow optimization, resource allocation | Improves throughput, reduces bottlenecks |\n\nThese capabilities are underpinned by machine learning (ML) algorithms that learn from large, heterogeneous datasets\u2014electronic health records (EHRs), imaging repositories, genomics, and real\u2011time sensor streams. The \u201cfast processing power\u201d and \u201chidden pattern detection\u201d noted in *Machine Learning Applications In Healthcare: The State Of Knowledge and Future Directions* (Mrinmoy\u202fRoy et\u202fal., 2023) illustrate the transformative potential of ML in sifting through data that would be intractable for humans.  \n\n---\n\n### 3.
