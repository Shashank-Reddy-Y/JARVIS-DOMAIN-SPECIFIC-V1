# Final Fix for "Meh" Answers - Making Them Awesome

## The Problem You Identified

The system was technically working but producing generic, vague answers that felt useless.

## Root Causes

1. **Synthesizer buried comprehensive answer** under summaries
2. **LLM prompts too soft** - didn't demand specificity
3. **Wrong content priority** - summaries first, details last

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Made QA Engine Answer THE STAR

**Before:** QA answer was just another section mixed with Wikipedia summaries

**After:** QA comprehensive answer is THE primary content, sources collapsed as supplementary

### Fix 2: Supercharged LLM Prompts

Added explicit requirements:
- 1500-2000 words minimum
- Use specific names, numbers, dates
- Cite actual papers, researchers, companies
- Include concrete examples (no vague statements)
- Compare approaches and perspectives
- Discuss challenges and future directions

Added 9-point detailed outline for every answer.

### Fix 3: Better Output Structure

Comprehensive LLM answer shown first and prominently, with supporting sources in collapsible sections.

## What Changed in Code

1. **synthesizer.py (lines 40-96)**: Prioritize qa_engine output as primary answer
2. **qa_engine.py (lines 52-100)**: Enhanced prompts with specific requirements

## Expected Result

**Before:**
- 300 words generic
- No specific details
- Felt like Wikipedia skimming

**After:**
- 1500-2000 words detailed
- Specific names, numbers, papers
- Multiple perspectives and examples
- Feels like expert analysis
