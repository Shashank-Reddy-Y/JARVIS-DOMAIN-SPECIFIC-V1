# 🎯 Answer Synthesis Fix - Real Answers, Not Raw Data

## 📋 Problem Identified

**Issue:** System was showing raw tool outputs instead of synthesized answers
```
❌ What you were seeing:
Found 5 papers related to 'query':
1. **Sample Paper 1 on Query**
   Authors: Author 1, Author 2
   ...
(Just listing mock data, no actual answer)
```

**What you needed:**
```
✅ Actual synthesized answer:
Based on research about [your topic], here are the key findings:
- Main insight 1
- Main insight 2
- Conclusion
```

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **New Module: `synthesizer.py`**

Intelligent answer synthesis that:
1. ✅ **Combines** information from multiple tools
2. ✅ **Synthesizes** into coherent answer
