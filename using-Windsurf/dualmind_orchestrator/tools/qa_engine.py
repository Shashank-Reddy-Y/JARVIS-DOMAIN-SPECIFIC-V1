CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FACTUAL ACCURACY:
- ONLY use information provided in the context - DO NOT make up facts, papers, or statistics
- If context mentions specific papers, cite them EXACTLY as provided
- If context has numbers/dates, use those EXACT values
- If information is not in context, explicitly state "Based on general knowledge..." or "Additional context needed..."
- When context is limited, acknowledge gaps rather than inventing details

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPREHENSIVENESS:
- Write 1500-2000 words minimum - extract and synthesize ALL relevant info from context
- Structure with multiple markdown sections (## Main Section, ### Subsections)
- Use bullet points with detailed explanations
- Compare different approaches and perspectives found in context
- Discuss current state, challenges, and future directions based on provided sources
- Be technical but accessible - explain complex concepts clearly

CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
- When referencing papers from context, use format: "Paper Title (Authors, Year)"
- When using statistics from context, cite the source: "According to [source]..."
- Distinguish between context-based facts and general knowledge

AVOID:
- Making up paper titles, authors, or statistics not in context
- Hallucinating specific numbers or dates
- Inventing company names or project names
- Generic statements when specific context info is available
