# Windows Encoding Fix for Emoji Support

## Problem
On Windows, the default console encoding (`cp1252`) doesn't support Unicode emoji characters (‚úÖ, üîÑ, ‚ùå, etc.), causing `UnicodeEncodeError` in logs.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

The `main.py` file has been updated to automatically fix this by:

1. **Detecting Windows platform**
2. **Reconfiguring stdout/stderr** to use UTF-8 encoding
3. **Setting file handlers** to UTF-8 encoding

### What was changed:
```python
# Fix Windows console encoding for Unicode/emoji support
if sys.platform == 'win32':
    import io
    # Reconfigure stdout and stderr to use UTF-8
    if sys.stdout.encoding != 'utf-8':
        sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')
    if sys.stderr.encoding != 'utf-8':
        sys.stderr = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stderr.buffer, encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')
```

## How to Test

Restart your application and you should see emoji properly in logs:
```
INFO - ‚úÖ Plan approved by verifier (score: 100/100)
INFO - üîÑ Adversarial iteration 1/2
INFO - ‚ùå Plan rejected (score: 65/100)
INFO - ‚ú® Generated improved plan
```

## Alternative Solutions (if issue persists)

### Option 1: Set Console Code Page (Windows Terminal)
Before running the app:
```cmd
chcp 65001
python main.py
```

### Option 2: Use Windows Terminal (Recommended)
Install Windows Terminal from Microsoft Store - it has better Unicode support than cmd.exe.

### Option 3: Environment Variable
Set before running:
```cmd
set PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python main.py
```

### Option 4: PowerShell UTF-8
In PowerShell:
```powershell
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
python main.py
```

## If You Still See Errors

The fix in `main.py` should handle this automatically, but if you still see encoding errors:

### Quick Fix: Remove Emojis from Orchestrator

Edit `orchestrator.py` and replace emoji with text:

```python
# Before:
self.logger.info(f"‚úÖ Plan approved by verifier (score: {score}/100)")
self.logger.info(f"üîÑ Adversarial iteration {iteration}/{max_iterations}")
self.logger.info(f"‚ùå Plan rejected (score: {score}/100)")

# After:
self.logger.info(f"[SUCCESS] Plan approved by verifier (score: {score}/100)")
self.logger.info(f"[ITERATION] Adversarial iteration {iteration}/{max_iterations}")
self.logger.info(f"[REJECTED] Plan rejected (score: {score}/100)")
```

## Why This Happens

**Windows Console Encoding:**
- Old Windows consoles use `cp1252` (Western European)
- `cp1252` only supports basic ASCII + some Western characters
- Emoji are Unicode characters outside this range
- Modern terminals (Windows Terminal, PowerShell Core) handle UTF-8 better

**The Fix:**
- Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding on Windows
- Replaces characters that can't be displayed instead of crashing
- Works transparently without changing your code

---

## Verification

After restart, check the first log line:
```
INFO - Logging initialized with UTF-8 encoding
```

If you see this, the fix is active! ‚úÖ

## System Impact: None

This fix:
- ‚úÖ Only affects logging output encoding
- ‚úÖ Doesn't change functionality
- ‚úÖ Safe for all platforms (only activates on Windows)
- ‚úÖ Maintains backward compatibility
- ‚úÖ Preserves all log information

---

## Status

üü¢ **FIXED** - The encoding configuration has been added to `main.py` and will automatically handle Unicode/emoji on Windows.

Just restart your application and the emoji logging errors should be resolved!
