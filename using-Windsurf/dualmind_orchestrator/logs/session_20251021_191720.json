The core idea is to optimize the neural network's weights and biases to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.\n\n### Background\n\nBackpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training artificial neural networks. It works by propagating the error backwards through the network, adjusting the weights and biases at each layer to minimize the total error. However, traditional backpropagation assumes that the activation functions used in the network are differentiable, which is not always the case.\n\n### Recent Advances\n\nRecent research has focused on developing biologically plausible learning algorithms that can achieve performance comparable to error backpropagation without requiring differentiable activation functions.
