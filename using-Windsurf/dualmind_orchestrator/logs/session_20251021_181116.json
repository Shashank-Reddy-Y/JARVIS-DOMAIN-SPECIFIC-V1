The final output is also clearly defined. However, the task plan does not specify the expected output format or length. Additionally, the 'created_at' field is not relevant to the task plan's content. The 'planner_version' and 'available_tools' fields are also not necessary. The 'estimated_steps' field is not accurate, as it is set to 1, but the pipeline has multiple steps. The 'llm_generated' field is not relevant to the task plan's content.",
