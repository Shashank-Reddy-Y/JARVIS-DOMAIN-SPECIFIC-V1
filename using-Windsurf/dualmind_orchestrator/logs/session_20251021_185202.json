Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving medical diagnosis accuracy by leveraging their ability to process and analyze vast amounts of medical data. However, the application of LLMs in medical diagnosis is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors, including data quality, model interpretability, and ethical concerns.\n\n**Related Research**\n-------------------\n\nSeveral recent studies have explored the application of LLMs in medical diagnosis. These studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in improving medical diagnosis accuracy, but also highlight the need for careful consideration of various factors, including:\n\n*   **Clinical relevance**: The ability of LLMs to accurately detect diseases that are relevant to clinical practice (Ma et al., 2025)\n*   **Model interpretability**: The ability of LLMs to provide transparent and interpretable explanations for their diagnostic predictions (Pellegrini et al., 2023)\n*   **Data quality**: The quality and availability of medical data used to train and evaluate LLMs (Ren et al., 2025)\n*   **Ethical concerns**: The potential risks and benefits of using LLMs in medical diagnosis, including concerns around bias, explainability, and patient autonomy (\u00d6zsoy et al., 2023)\n\n**Recent Studies**\n------------------\n\nSeveral recent studies have explored the application of LLMs in medical diagnosis. These studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in improving medical diagnosis accuracy, but also highlight the need for careful consideration of various factors.\n\n*   **Memorize and Rank: Elevating Large Language Models for Clinical Diagnosis Prediction** (Ma et al., 2025): This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in improving clinical diagnosis accuracy by leveraging their ability to process and analyze vast amounts of medical data.\n*   **DiaLLMs: EHR Enhanced Clinical Conversational System for Clinical Test Recommendation and Diagnosis Prediction** (Ren et al., 2025): This study highlights the importance of incorporating Electronic Health Records (EHRs) into LLMs to improve medical diagnosis accuracy.\n*   **KERAP: A Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning Approach for Accurate Zero-shot Diagnosis Prediction Using Multi-agent LLMs** (Xie et al., 2025): This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in improving medical diagnosis accuracy by leveraging their ability to reason and integrate knowledge from multiple sources.\n*   **Xplainer: From X-Ray Observations to Explainable Zero-Shot Diagnosis** (Pellegrini et al., 2023): This study highlights the importance of model interpretability in medical diagnosis and demonstrates the potential of LLMs in providing transparent and interpretable explanations for their diagnostic predictions.\n*   **ChatCAD: Interactive Computer-Aided Diagnosis on Medical Image using Large Language Models** (Wang et al., 2023): This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in improving medical diagnosis accuracy by leveraging their ability to process and analyze medical images.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nThe application of LLMs in medical diagnosis is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors, including data quality, model interpretability, and ethical concerns. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in improving medical diagnosis accuracy, but also highlight the need for careful consideration of these factors. Future research should continue to explore the potential of LLMs in medical diagnosis and address the challenges and limitations associated with their use.\n\n**References**\n--------------\n\n*   Ma, M.
