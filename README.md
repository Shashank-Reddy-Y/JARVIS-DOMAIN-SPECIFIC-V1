# 🧠 [DualMind Orchestrator](https://dualmind-frontend-app-ai.vercel.app)

A **GAN-Inspired Multi-Agent Task Planning & Execution System** that demonstrates intelligent task planning, tool usage, adversarial self-verification, and report generation.
*This project is developed as a domain specific application of the improvised architecture inspired from HuggingGPT*
*Currently functions like a research assistant*

## 🌟 Overview

DualMind Orchestrator is an advanced AI system that implements a **Generator-Discriminator architecture** inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It builds upon the concepts introduced by HuggingGPT while introducing several key innovations.

### Inspiration from HuggingGPT

DualMind draws inspiration from HuggingGPT's approach to task decomposition and tool utilization, but extends it with:

- **Adversarial Verification**: Unlike HuggingGPT's single-path execution, DualMind introduces a verifier that critically evaluates and improves plans
- **Iterative Refinement**: Plans are refined through multiple iterations based on verifier feedback
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust error handling with automatic fallbacks when tools fail
- **Self-Improving Architecture**: The system learns from past executions to improve future performance

### Key Improvements Over Traditional Approaches

1. **Dual-Agent Architecture**: 
   - **Planner (Generator)**: Creates initial task pipelines
   - **Verifier (Discriminator)**: Critically evaluates and improves plans
   - Continuous feedback loop between agents leads to higher quality outputs

2. **Enhanced Tool Integration**:
   - Dynamic tool selection with fallback mechanisms
   - Tools are selected based on their suitability for specific subtasks
   - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **Self-Verification**:
   - Every plan is automatically verified for quality and feasibility
   - Verification includes checking tool availability, parameter validation, and logical consistency
   - Plans are scored across multiple dimensions (relevance, completeness, logical flow, etc.)

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation when tools fail
   - Automatic fallback to alternative tools or approaches
   - Detailed error reporting and recovery mechanisms

## ✨ Key Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Planner and Verifier LLMs work together in an adversarial setup
- 🔧 **Extensible Tool System**: Modular tools for various tasks (research, summarization, analysis, visualization)
- ✅ **Self-Verification**: Automatic plan validation and improvement suggestions
- 📊 **Visual Interface**: Beautiful UI showing the complete reasoning process
- 📄 **PDF Report Generation**: Automatic creation of structured reports
- 🛠️ **Fallback Mechanisms**: Works even when APIs are unavailable (demo mode)

## 🖥️ Frontend Development

### Available Scripts

In the `frontend` directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server with hot-reload
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder
- `npm run preview` - Serves the production build locally for testing
- `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint to check code quality
